# JNSQ-MPE-Compatibility-Pack

# NOTE, THIS DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT MAKE EELOO COMPATIBLE, IT DOES NOT RESCALE THE PLANETS, CURRENTLY WORKING ON PATCH TO FIX THIS

For those who think JNSQ, GEP, and GPP together aren't enough planets

This allows for compatibility between JNSQ and MPE

I'm assuming you are capable of manual mod instalation, and I wouldn't reccomend using CKAN as CKAN will probably freak out that things will be missing

Dependancies are MPE and its dependancies, Sigma-Dimensions and its dependancies

to install, simply drag the GameData folder into the KSP install directory, or the contents of GameData into the KSP GameData folder
It might ask to replace some, hit yes.
Now you also need to navigate to MPE\Bonus and delete ReEeloo (it's a good idea to have a backup of MPE on hand for a non-JNSQ save)
